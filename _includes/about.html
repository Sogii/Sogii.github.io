    <p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sigi. I'm someone who loves connecting technology with people through compelling storytelling. I thrive on crafting interactive experiences that engage audiences and make complex ideas feel accessible and exciting.

      I'd love to hear your ideas, and work out what we can mean for each other. I can get quite enthusiastic when exploring new opportunities together, so let's grab a coffee and chat!.</p>
